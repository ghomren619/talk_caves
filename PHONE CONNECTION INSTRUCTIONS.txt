I'll quickly check the backend and frontend configs to ensure mobile access works over your LAN, then give you the exact steps (IP, host flags, firewall tips).

I'm going to open the socket client code to see whether it connects to the current origin or an explicit backend URL. That affects whether we need to set `VITE_API_BASE` for phone access.

### Let your phone use it on your Wi‑Fi (LAN)

- **Both devices on same Wi‑Fi**; disable VPN/guest network isolation.

1) Find your PC’s LAN IP
- PowerShell:
```powershell
ipconfig
```
- Note the IPv4 address, e.g. `192.168.1.50`.

2) Start the backend (already listens on all interfaces)
```powershell
cd backend
./run.bat
```
- Allow the Windows Firewall prompt for Private networks.
- Backend will be at `http://192.168.1.50:8000` from your phone.

3) Configure the frontend to talk to the backend IP
- Create `frontend/.env`:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE=http://192.168.1.50:8000
```

4) Start the frontend and expose it on LAN
```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev -- --host
```
- Open on your phone: `http://192.168.1.50:5173`

If you prefer a preview build:
```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview -- --host
```
- Then open: `http://192.168.1.50:5173`

Notes
- The backend already sets CORS to `*`, and Socket.IO allows all origins.
- If you can’t connect from your phone, add a firewall inbound rule for TCP 8000 and 5173 (Private profile).
